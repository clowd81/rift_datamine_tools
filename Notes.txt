PAKS contains two "drag and droppable" batch files for the QuickBMS scripts
You may want to change the hardcoded locations
LZMA2 extracts the file as-is
PAK extracts the file into a folder named after the file

The Audio Tools contain many hard-to-find tools for working with WWise/RIFF/RIFX files
The QuickBMS script contained in there will extract WWise BNKs but will not keep the names. It will rename the files to match their filetype
BNKEXTR will preserve file names but will not do the renaming.
You will still need the other tools to convert the files into a playable format.
